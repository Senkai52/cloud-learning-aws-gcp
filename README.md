# Cloud Learning · AWS → GCP

A structured, hands-on learning repo to master **AWS first (12 weeks)** and **GCP next (8 weeks)** — tailored for a Python backend developer (FastAPI/Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, CI/CD, AI).

## 🎯 Goals
- Build & deploy production-grade **APIs** on AWS (Lambda/API Gateway, ECS Fargate) and GCP (Cloud Run).
- Use managed **PostgreSQL** (AWS RDS / GCP Cloud SQL) and **Object Storage** (S3 / Cloud Storage).
- Add **monitoring/logging** (CloudWatch / Cloud Logging) and basic **messaging** (SQS/SNS).
- Set up **CI/CD** with GitHub Actions → AWS/GCP.
- Optional certs: **AWS Certified Developer – Associate**, **Google Associate Cloud Engineer**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (AWS · 12 weeks)**: Foundations → DB/API → Serverless → Containers → Monitoring → E2E project.
- **Phase 2 (GCP · 8 weeks)**: Foundations → Cloud Run+SQL → Serverless → Vertex AI → E2E project.

👉 Use the Kanban board (GitHub Projects) to track weekly tasks. Run `scripts/setup_github.sh` once after creating the repo on GitHub.
